BlinqPay Accessment

## Getting Started

- [Link to download the application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AcIiu3hR8tdApA_P3qOH3-Xy0FnqjCAw/view?usp=sharing)

- [Link to Github repo(Master branch)](https://github.com/whizgenius1/blinqpay_assessment.git)

The app consist of 3 screens majorly
The Users Screen
The Posts Screen
The User Details Screen (can be reached when you tap on the username on the Post screen and also on the user item on the user screen)

I used cached network image to save the image in memory, but most of the image URL returns 404
I also used cache network video to cache the video in memory

Async notifier provider was used to fetch the data, this is to prevent the reloading of data anytime the user come into any of the main screen(user and post screen), and also to expose the data to the applicationn so they can be access when needed, ()
For animation, I used Hero animation (nothing fancy), 

I did not bother to use isolate because it was not neccessary, since the recequest was not much and it was not putting a strain on the device

Thank you
